      "I will first list the files in `data/raw/aws_doc_batch_1` to understand their names, which can provide clues for categorization. Then, I will read the content of these files to determine their meaning and group them into categories. Finally, I will create the `category_files.json` with the categorized file paths.I made a mistake and used a relative path. I need to use an absolute path. The correct path is `/home/leobit/Development/Projects/aws-doc-ragqa/research/data/raw/aws_doc_batch_1`. I will now list the files in that directory.The directory contains many git-ignored files, and the initial listing was empty. To proceed, I'll try listing the files again, this time including the git-ignored ones, to get a complete picture of the directory's contents.The file list reveals clear naming conventions, suggesting categories like `properties`, `resource`, `how-to-guide`, `tutorial`, `code`, `concepts`, `security`, `integration`, `marketplace`, `reinforcement-learning`, and `geospatial`. I'll categorize the files based on these patterns, using file content checks to confirm my initial assumptions, starting with a `aws-properties-*`, an `aws-resource-*`, and a how-to guide file.I'm getting a \"file not found\" error. The issue is likely the file path; `read_many_files` needs a relative path from my current directory, `/home/leobit/Development/Projects/aws-doc-ragqa/research`. I'll correct the path to `data/raw/aws_doc_batch_1/aws-properties-sagemaker-app-resourcespec.md` and retry.`read_many_files` is failing. I'll try `read_file` on each file to isolate the problem. If that fails, I'll resort to `cat` via `run_shell_command`.`read_file` with an absolute path works, confirming my file content assumption. This file details SageMaker App resource properties. Now, I'll read the other two files to verify my remaining assumptions.`aws-resource-sagemaker-app.md` details the `AWS::SageMaker::App` resource, confirming my `resource` category assumption. Next, I'll verify `automating-sagemaker-with-eventbridge.md` as a how-to guide."
